## What this site covers

This docs site is the public entry point for the platform documentation. It is
meant to stay lightweight and readable while still covering the areas people
need most during development, review, and deployment.

The source material still lives in `docs/`, while this site curates the
platform-facing material into a separate VitePress app that can be deployed
independently.

## Next steps

The published sections cover the ratings and title search API surface, the internal portal, and
the self-hosting story. The navigation and theme are already scaffolded so the
documentation can grow without changing the site structure.
